# Unraid Scripts Collection

This repository contains a set of custom scripts designed to streamline and automate tasks on Unraid. A key feature of this repository is its integration with Plex Media Server and Dell iDRAC systems via the Redfish API. These scripts enable advanced functionality such as monitoring Plex traffic and dynamically managing the power state of a Dell rack-mounted server equipped with iDRAC, optimizing both performance and energy usage.

## Definitions

**1. Overseerr**
- **Definition**: Overseerr is an open-source, web-based media request management tool that integrates with media servers like Plex and Jellyfin. It allows users to request new movies or TV shows, which can then be processed and added to the media server automatically. Overseerr provides a user-friendly interface for managing requests, approvals, and notifications.

**2. Plex**
- **Definition**: Plex is a popular media server platform that allows users to organize, stream, and share their media libraries, including movies, TV shows, music, and photos. The server application manages the media library, while the Plex client apps provide streaming capabilities across multiple devices. Plex also supports plugins and add-ons to enhance its features.

**3. UNRAID**
- **Definition**: UNRAID is an operating system designed for network-attached storage (NAS) and server management. It allows users to combine different types of storage devices into a unified system, providing features such as data protection, virtualization, and the ability to run various applications in Docker containers or virtual machines. UNRAID is often used for home and small office setups that require flexible storage and media server capabilities.

**4. Sonarr**
- **Definition**: Sonarr is an open-source tool used for automating the process of downloading, sorting, and managing TV shows. It monitors multiple torrent or Usenet indexers for new episodes, downloads them, and moves them into the correct folder structure in a media library. Sonarr can integrate with media servers like Plex, enabling seamless media management and viewing.

**5. Radarr**
- **Definition**: Radarr is a counterpart to Sonarr, specifically designed for automating the process of managing movies. It monitors movie indexers for new releases, handles automatic downloading, and organizes downloaded content into a media library. Like Sonarr, Radarr integrates with Plex for easy access to movies on various devices.

**6. iDRAC**
- **Definition**: iDRAC (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller) is a management solution embedded in Dell servers that allows for remote monitoring, management, and troubleshooting of hardware. It provides out-of-band access to the serverâ€™s operating system, making it possible to control the server remotely, perform tasks like rebooting, updating firmware, and diagnosing hardware issues, all without needing to be physically present.

**7. Redfish**
- **Definition**: Redfish is a standardized API specification for managing and monitoring hardware in data centers. Developed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), it provides a RESTful interface for interacting with servers, enabling remote management and automation tasks such as power control, hardware monitoring, and configuration.

**8. Plex API**
- **Definition**: The Plex API is an interface that allows developers to interact with and automate Plex Media Server functionalities. It provides endpoints for managing libraries, retrieving media metadata, and controlling playback. The API facilitates integration with third-party applications to extend Plex's capabilities and enable custom workflows.

**9. Overseerr API**
- **Definition**: The Overseerr API is an application programming interface that allows developers to interact programmatically with the Overseerr app. It provides endpoints for managing media requests, handling user interactions, and automating request processing. This API enables integration with media servers and other applications for seamless media management.
